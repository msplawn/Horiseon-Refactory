# **Project Description**
For this project I was given a website to refactor. The idea was to improve accessibility 
and clean up the HTML and CSS in a more semantic manner. I made the site more accessible
by adding descriptive alt tags to images, adjusting some visual elements to make text
more legible, and resizing images to improve load times. I also cleaned up the code
to make it more elegantly structured and semantically legible. By giving more descriptive
semantic labelling to previously vague elements I was able to improve the overall SEO of the site.

# **Usage**
The site is promotes an SEO company Horiseo and explains the services they offer.
